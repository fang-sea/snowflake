problem statement
design of ELT
build and test
presentation or data visualization if necessary
Since we will not have discussion sessions: what's built to 
meet the requirement? what's not built based on the 
requirement and why?
any potential improvements that can't be done due to time 
constraints.


Problem Statement:

WaFd would like to evaluate the markets in which we operate to determine how to better meet the needs of current and potential customers.  


Strategy:
In order to help WaFd gain valuable insight into the markets in which we operate, the data team has gathered information from the US Census and other 
language data and created a simple data model that can provide high level insight into these markets.  The end user would access this data via the CUSTOMER_VIEW 
currently in snowflake most likely via a data vizualation tool.

Improvements:
In the real world, the value of this information would be increased greatly with Census Tract data to be able to drill down to the neigborhood level.

I would typically provide an Entity-Relationship Diagram as part of my documentation, but I don't have a personal license for such software currently.

Notes:

The 'English Only' data element is marked as 'NO DATA' because there is currently not enough information to answer that question.
